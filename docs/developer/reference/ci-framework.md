# CI framework internals

The `_CI/` directory is the vendored [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/)-based workflow framework behind `./workflow.cmd`. This page is the lookup reference for its building blocks — for the task catalog see [Invoke task catalog](invoke-tasks.md), for the design rationale see [The _CI tasks architecture](../explanation/the-ci-tasks-architecture.md).

## Shared utilities (`_CI/tasks/shared.py`)

| Utility | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `execute(ctx, cmd)` | Run a shell command; raise `SystemExit(1)` on failure |
| `@run(cmd)` | Decorator — replace function body with a shell command |
| `@logged(name)` | Decorator — print pass/fail status after execution |
| `run_steps(*fns)` | Run all steps, accumulate failures, raise once at the end |

## Configuration (`_CI/tasks/configuration.py`)

Centralized constants shared across task modules:

| Constant | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PATHS` | Standard directories targeted by linters/formatters: `src/ _CI/tasks/ tests/` |
| `SECURITY_OVERRIDE_ENV` | Environment variable name for security audit overrides |
| `IGNORE_PATTERN` | Regex for parsing vulnerability IDs with optional expiry dates |
| `LOCAL_MODULE` | Path to `_CI/tasks/local.py`, the project-owned task module (in `__init__.py`) |
| `IMAGE_NAME` | Container image name for the deps cache |
| `DOCKERFILE_DEPS` | Dockerfile for the deps image (also a deps-image tag input) |
| `DEPS_IMAGE_FILE` | Where `container.publish` records the resolved image reference |
| `PYSCN_REPORTS_DIR` | Directory for pyscn HTML reports |
| `SENTINEL` | Bootstrap sentinel file path |

## The deps image and its cache

### It runs as a non-root user

`Dockerfile.deps` ends with `USER 1001`, so nothing in CI runs as root. Two things have
to line up for that to work, and both are in the Dockerfile:

- **`/app` is chowned to 1001.** The image is built with `--no-install-project`, so
  `uv run` installs the project into `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` (`/app/.venv`) at job
  time. Left root-owned, every task would fail on the first write.
- **The user has a home directory.** uv caches under `$HOME`.

**The uid is not arbitrary.** 1001 is the uid GitHub's hosted runners own the
mounted workspace with. If your runner uses a different uid, the workspace arrives
unwritable and jobs fail with permission errors on paths under the checkout — change the
uid in `Dockerfile.deps` to match. That edit changes the deps-image tag automatically,
because the Dockerfile is one of the tag's inputs, so you will not be served a stale
image built for the old uid.

CI jobs run inside a prebuilt image holding the project's dependencies, so each job
starts with a warm environment instead of resolving from scratch. `container.publish`
builds and publishes it; `.deps-image` records the reference downstream jobs consume.

**The tag is content-addressed.** `deps_image_tag()` hashes the lockfile, `Dockerfile.deps`
and the resolved base-image string together (length-prefixed, so no combination of
inputs can collide with another). Change any one of them and you get a new tag — which
is what stops CI from silently reusing an image built from a stale Dockerfile or base.

**The reference is digest-pinned.** `container.publish` resolves the published image to
`repository@sha256:…` (via the local repo digest) rather than handing
downstream jobs a mutable tag. A tag repointed between the build job and a consumer job
therefore cannot change the container that consumer runs in.

**Residual risk — reuse of an existing tag.** When the tag already exists in the registry,
the build is skipped and that image is reused. This keeps CI fast, but it trusts whoever
pushed the tag first: an actor able to pre-seed `<repo>-deps:<tag>` would have later jobs
run inside their image, including the publish job that holds PyPI OIDC. Digest pinning does not remove this — you would pin their digest.

Because the mitigation is an access-control one, keep it that way:

- Restrict write access to the `<repo>-deps` package to this pipeline. Only
  `build-deps-image` needs `packages: write`; every other job runs at `packages: read`.
- Audit who else can publish packages in the org, and treat that set as trusted to the
  same degree as the release credentials.
- To remove the trade-off entirely, drop the `manifest inspect` skip in
  `publish_deps_image()` so every run rebuilds from the repository. The cost is a full
  image build per gated run.

## Bootstrap framework (`_CI/tasks/bootstrap.py`)

A sentinel file (`_CI/.bootstrapped`) ensures first-time setup runs exactly once; every task inherits bootstrap as an Invoke `pre` task. New setup steps are added by appending to the `STEPS` list:

```python
STEPS: list[BootstrapStep] = [
    BootstrapStep(
        name='pre-commit hooks',
        action=install_pre_commit,
        prompt='Install pre-commit hooks? [y/N] ',
        ci_behavior='skip',  # 'run' or 'skip' in CI
    ),
    # Add more steps here
]
```

Each step has a `prompt` for local interactive use and a `ci_behavior` for unattended execution — when the `CI` environment variable is set, prompts are suppressed and steps execute or skip accordingly. See [Customize the bootstrap](../how-to/customize-the-bootstrap.md) for the recipe.

## Directory layout

```
_CI/
  tasks/
    __init__.py        Namespace aggregation + bootstrap wiring
    configuration.py   Centralized constants
    shared.py          Core decorators and utilities
    bootstrap.py       One-time setup framework
    build.py           Package build
    container.py       Docker image
    develop.py         Pre-commit management
    document.py        ProperDocs documentation
    format_.py         Ruff formatting + import sorting
    lint.py            Ruff, pylint, ty, complexipy, commitizen
    quality.py         pyscn analysis
    release.py         Version bump, changelog, publish
    secure.py          pip-audit, CycloneDX SBOM
    test.py            pytest
    github.py          Host-specific helpers (registry, release PR/MR)
    local.py           YOUR tasks — never overwritten by `copier update`
  lib/
    vendor/            Vendored Invoke + dependencies (committed — don't hand-edit)
    vendor.txt         Pinned dependency list
```

Everything in that tree is template-owned and replaced on `copier update` — **except
`local.py`**. It is listed in the template's `_skip_if_exists`, so it is seeded once and then
left alone. Put project-specific tasks there and updates stay conflict-free; put them in any
other module and that hunk needs resolving on every update. `__init__.py` includes it
automatically when present, with the same bootstrap pre-task the built-in namespaces get, so
there is no registration step. See [Add a workflow task](../how-to/add-a-workflow-task.md).
