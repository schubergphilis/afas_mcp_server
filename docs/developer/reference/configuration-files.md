# Configuration files

Every config file shipped at the project root, what it's for, and what NOT to edit.

## `pyproject.toml`

The single source of truth for project metadata and tool configuration. Sections worth knowing about:

| Section | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[project]` | You | Name, description, classifiers, scripts, dependencies. Edit freely. |
| `[project.scripts]` | You | Console entry points. Add a `__main__.py` and an entry under this section to ship a CLI. |
| `[dependency-groups]` | You | Add deps via `uv add --group <name>`. See [Dependency groups](dependency-groups.md). |
| `[tool.uv]` | Template | uv-specific settings, required uv version. Don't lower `required-version`. |
| `[tool.ruff]` | Template (rule list), you (line-length etc.) | Rule selection is opinionated; ad-hoc disables go in code with `# noqa`. |
| `[tool.pylint]` | Template | Strict-by-default. Per-message disables go in code. |
| `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` | Template (framework), you (markers) | Don't disable coverage; add markers as needed. |
| `[tool.coverage]` | Template | `fail_under` is ratcheted upward automatically once the ratchet engages. Don't lower it. |
| `[tool.test-ratchet]` | Template (knob), you (mode) | `mode = "auto-detect"` (default) keeps the coverage ratchet dormant while the scaffolded `test_sanity` is in place; `mode = "strict"` engages it on run #1. See [Testing strategy](../explanation/testing-strategy.md#dormant-during-scaffold). |
| `[tool.tox]` | Template | Generated from `min_python_version` / `max_python_version`. |
| `[tool.commitizen]` | Template | Conventional-Commits parser config used by `cz changelog` and the lint hook. The template does **not** use commitizen's autorelease — the bump is chosen explicitly via `./workflow.cmd release -i <type>`. |
| `[tool.docker-versions]` | Template | The one image `Dockerfile.deps` builds on, pinned by tag *and* digest. |

## `uv.lock`

Locked dependency graph. Managed by uv; never edit by hand. Commit it.

## `tox.ini`

Empty placeholder. Tox config lives in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.tox]`. The file exists because some IDEs (and older `tox` versions) expect it.

## `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

Hook definitions, split across three git stages:

| Stage | Hooks | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `commit-msg` | commitizen (conventional-commit format) | the message |
| `pre-commit` | ruff format, ruff, pylint, complexipy | **staged files only** |
| `pre-commit` | ty, pyscn, `.security-overrides` validation | whole project |
| `pre-push` | the test suite | whole project |

**Per-file tools get only the staged files.** A one-line change costs a one-file check
rather than a sweep of `src/ _CI/tasks/ tests/`. Each of those hooks wraps the task in
`sh -c '… --paths="$*"' --`, which collapses the file list pre-commit appends into the
single `--paths` value Invoke expects — passed bare, Invoke reads the second filename as
another task name and fails. Filenames containing spaces are not supported by that
marshalling.

**Two checks stay whole-project deliberately**, because a per-file view gives a wrong
answer rather than a partial one:

- **ty** — type checking is whole-program. A changed signature surfaces as an error in the
  *callers*, so narrowing the input hides exactly the errors worth catching.
- **pyscn** — reports dead code and duplicate blocks, both relationships *between* files. A
  function only looks dead once you know nothing else calls it.

Any of these tasks also takes `--paths` directly, e.g.
`./workflow.cmd lint.pylint --paths="src/thing.py"`.

**The suite sits on pre-push** on purpose. Running it on every commit was slow enough to
push people towards `--no-verify`, which disables *all* of these at once; on pre-push it
still stops anything broken reaching the remote. It also runs `test.pytest` rather than
the `test` aggregator, so it gates without rewriting the README badge or ratcheting
`fail_under` — writes that belong to a deliberate `./workflow.cmd test`, not to a hook
firing mid-commit.

Edit to add hooks; don't remove the existing ones without thinking — they keep the main
branch clean.

## `.security-overrides`

Allow-list for pip-audit findings. Each entry is a single token, `<VULN_ID>[::YYYY-MM-DD]`,
with the justification in a `#` comment — anything after the id on the same line is not
part of the entry. See [Triage a security finding](../how-to/triage-a-security-finding.md).

## `.gitignore`

Standard Python + the project's own outputs (`reports/`, `site/`, `dist/`, `.deps-image`, `_CI/.bootstrapped`).

## `Dockerfile.deps`

Multi-stage build for the dependency-cache image. Reads `[tool.docker-versions]` from `pyproject.toml`. See [Build and push a container](../how-to/build-and-push-a-container.md).

## `properdocs.yml`

Docs site config. Sections worth knowing:

- `nav:` — the navigation tree.
- `theme:` — `mkdocs` theme with auto color mode.
- `watch:` — `src/` is watched so docstring edits live-reload via mkdocstrings.
- `plugins:` — `include-markdown` (pulls README into `index.md`) and `mkdocstrings` (API reference from Google-style docstrings).

## `workflow.cmd` and `workflow.cmd.bat`

Polyglot launcher: a shell script on Unix, a batch file on Windows. Resolves to `uv run python -m _CI.invoke -- <args>`. Don't edit.

## `.github/` or `.gitlab-ci.yml`

The chosen host's CI config (only one of these exists per project, per the `git_hosting_service` answer). Edit to add jobs; preserve the existing lint/test/build flow if you want `copier update` to keep working.

## `.copier-answers.yml`

Copier's state file. Records the template URL, the revision, and your answers. Managed by copier — never edit it manually. To pull template updates into this project run `uvx copier update --trust` from the project root — see the [copier docs](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/updating/).
