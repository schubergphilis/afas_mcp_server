# The scaffold

AFAS MCP Server was generated from the
[Paleofuturistic Python](https://github.com/schubergphilis/paleofuturistic_python) copier template. The
template gave this project a working toolchain — dependency management, a task runner, testing, security,
docs, and CI — so you could start writing code instead of wiring plumbing.

Everything under this **Developer** section documents that inherited scaffold, kept apart from the rest of
the site so your project's own documentation stays about *your software*. This page is the quick tour; each
heading links the deeper pages. For documenting your own software, start with
[Document your project](how-to/document-your-project.md).

## uv for everything

Every Python operation — virtualenvs, dependency resolution, the lockfile, fetching interpreters, publishing
— goes through [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). One tool, one config surface (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`),
reproducible environments on your laptop and in CI.

→ Full rationale: [How uv is used](explanation/how-uv-is-used.md)

## The `_CI` task runner

`./workflow.cmd <task>` is the single entry point for every development action (`format`, `lint`, `test`,
`build`, `release`, …). It dispatches into vendored [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) tasks under `_CI/`,
so a fresh clone works immediately with no extra install step. See the
[Invoke task catalog](reference/invoke-tasks.md) for the full list.

Prefer `./workflow.cmd` for everything it covers — it's what CI runs, so your local results match. Running
a tool directly with `uv run <tool>` is an *advanced* escape hatch: fine for a one-off it doesn't cover,
but you then own the environment and flags. If you reach for one regularly, model it as a task instead
(a two-minute change — see *Add a workflow task* below).

→ How it's built: [The _CI tasks architecture](explanation/the-ci-tasks-architecture.md)
· [Add a workflow task](how-to/add-a-workflow-task.md)
· [Customize the bootstrap](how-to/customize-the-bootstrap.md)

## Testing and the coverage ratchet

`./workflow.cmd test` runs pytest with branch coverage. Coverage has a *ratchet*: once you start writing
real tests, the `fail_under` floor only ever moves up, so coverage can't silently regress. tox runs the
suite across your whole Python version range. See [Run tests for one Python version](how-to/run-tests-for-one-python-version.md).

→ Full rationale: [Testing strategy](explanation/testing-strategy.md)

## Security and the SBOM

`./workflow.cmd secure` runs [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) and builds a CycloneDX SBOM
that ships inside your wheel. Findings you've reviewed are suppressed via `.security-overrides`.
See [Triage a security finding](how-to/triage-a-security-finding.md).

→ Full rationale: [SBOM and security model](explanation/sbom-and-security-model.md)

## Continuous integration

The project ships a GitHub Actions workflow
that runs the same `./workflow.cmd` tasks you run locally — lint, the full tox test matrix, and build — so
CI and your machine never disagree. The matrix is generated from your Python version range.

→ Full rationale: [Testing strategy](explanation/testing-strategy.md)

## The principles behind all of it

The scaffold's choices — pipelines that only run template commands, dependency groups over extras, ruff +
ty over the older stack, vendored CI tooling — were deliberate. They ship with this project so you can read
them offline.

→ [Design principles](explanation/design-principles.md)

## Keeping the scaffold up to date

This project stays linked to the template through `.copier-answers.yml`. To pull in later template
improvements, run `uvx copier update --trust` from the project root — see the
[copier update docs](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/updating/).

Generation-time topics — the copier questions, switching git hosts, changing the Python version range —
live in the template's own documentation:
[Using the template](https://schubergphilis.github.io/paleofuturistic_python/).
