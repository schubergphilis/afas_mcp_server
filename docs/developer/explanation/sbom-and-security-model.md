# SBOM and security model

The scaffold's security pipeline has two layers: known-vulnerability scanning and SBOM generation. This page explains what each layer does and what threat model it addresses.

## The threat model

The scaffold assumes this project:

- Publishes a Python package consumed by people its maintainers mostly don't know.
- Has a dependency graph that's large and changes frequently.
- Will, eventually, have one of its dependencies ship a vulnerability.
- Will eventually get asked by a downstream consumer "is your software affected by CVE-X?" — faster than anyone could audit by hand.

The pipeline answers those questions before the questions are asked.

## Layer 1 — pip-audit

`./workflow.cmd secure.audit` runs [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit) against `uv.lock`, comparing every pinned package against the [PyPI advisory database](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database).

What it catches: a vulnerability with a known CVE/PYSEC ID affecting a version in the lockfile.

What it doesn't catch:

- Zero-days (no advisory exists yet).
- Vulnerabilities in the project's *own* code.
- Misuse of a safe dependency.

Runs on every CI pipeline.

## Layer 2 — CycloneDX SBOM

`./workflow.cmd secure.sbom-extract --write` generates a [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) 1.7 bill of materials and writes it to `src/afas_mcp_server/sbom.cdx.json`. Because that path is inside the package data tree, `uv build` automatically ships the SBOM **inside the wheel** — a downstream consumer unpacks the wheel and finds `afas_mcp_server/sbom.cdx.json` alongside the Python modules.

### What's in it

**Metadata header** declares:

- A `lifecycles` entry of `phase: build` — this SBOM was produced during the build, not as a post-shipment inventory.
- A `tools.components` list naming what produced the SBOM (cyclonedx-python-lib, uv, the project's own generator), each with a version pin.
- `supplier` + `authors` derived from `pyproject.toml`'s `[project.authors]`.
- A `properties` entry recording the chosen `git_hosting_service` answer for downstream tools that want template-aware context.

**Components** are organised by **scope** so a consumer can distinguish what ships from what doesn't:

| Source | CycloneDX `scope` | Source path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project itself (root) | `required` | `[project]` block in pyproject.toml; root carries the project's licence and a `vcs` external_reference pointing at the git remote when present |
| Runtime dependencies | `required` | `uv export --no-dev` against `uv.lock` — exactly what ships in the wheel |
| Dev / lint / test / docs / quality / security groups | `optional` | full lockfile via `uv export --all-groups`, minus the runtime set |
| Vendored CI tooling | `excluded` | every package in `_CI/lib/vendor.txt` |
| Pipeline components | `excluded` | GitHub Actions (`uses:`), sourced from `_CI/tasks/github.py`'s `iter_pipeline_components()` |

Plus one **synthetic build-environment component** (type `platform`, scope `excluded`) that groups the vendored + pipeline material into a single sub-graph.

**Dependencies** form a two-level graph:

- The project root depends on each runtime + dev component and on the build-environment.
- The build-environment depends on the vendored + pipeline components.

Reading top-down: "the project depends on these runtime + dev components for itself, and on the build-environment to be assembled. The build-environment in turn depends on these vendored + pipeline components."

### Per-component enrichment

Each PyPI component (runtime, dev, vendored) carries:

- **`licenses`** — declared SPDX expression. The lookup walks `PEP 639 License-Expression → legacy License header → LICENSE-File text → Trove classifier mapping`. Vendored entries first try text-detection over the `_CI/lib/vendor/<name>/LICENSE*` files (the vendoring tool drops dist-info but keeps the LICENSE), then defer to the venv-installed copy when the same package is also a transitive dev dep. A handful of packages with no licence-bearing file locally end up with `licenses: []` — graceful degradation rather than failure.
- **`hashes`** — SHA-256 from `uv.lock`'s `wheels[*].hash` (or `sdist.hash` fallback). Pipeline and vendored components carry no hash here.
- **`external_references`** — every PyPI component points at its PyPI project page (`type=website`); GitHub Actions point at their repo (`type=vcs`).

### Validation

`./workflow.cmd secure.sbom-validate` runs the CycloneDX 1.7 JSON-schema validator in a clean `uv run python` subprocess (so the venv-installed validator wins over the older vendored `jsonschema` that the workflow.cmd launcher places earlier on `sys.path`). The aggregate `./workflow.cmd secure` runs all sub-steps; a clean run means: no known vulns, a fresh SBOM written, validated against the schema.

### What this enables

- A downstream consumer can extract the SBOM from the wheel with `unzip -p <wheel> afas_mcp_server/sbom.cdx.json` or `importlib.resources` — no separate artefact to track.
- A security responder can answer "are we affected by X?" against this project in seconds, not hours.
- Compliance frameworks (SLSA, NIST SSDF, EU CRA) that mandate SBOMs are satisfied — the SBOM travels with the artefact instead of needing to be re-correlated post-release.

The SBOM is part of every release.


## Layer 4 — build provenance

The SBOM says what is *inside* your artifact. Provenance says where it *came from* — and unlike the SBOM, it is not self-reported. `actions/attest-build-provenance` signs a statement binding the exact file digests to the workflow, commit and runner that produced them, and that signature chains to GitHub's Sigstore instance rather than to anything this project controls. A forged SBOM is a text edit; a forged attestation is not.

Anyone who downloads a release can verify it:

```bash
gh attestation verify afas_mcp_server-<version>-py3-none-any.whl --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

Order matters in the publish job: `release.dist` builds into `dist/`, the attestation is taken over those files, and `release.publish --prebuilt` uploads them *without* rebuilding. If you change that sequence so the artifacts are rebuilt after being attested, you will publish files no attestation refers to, and verification will fail — reading as tampering rather than as a fresh build.

## What about overrides?

`.security-overrides` is a project-local allow-list with mandatory expiry dates. It applies to `pip-audit`. It does **not** suppress findings in the SBOM — those continue to show the world the full truth. Override = "we accept this locally for now," not "make this invisible."

The expiry dates are load-bearing: a stale override is a security regression hidden in plain sight. The lint config doesn't enforce this; treat it as a code-review convention.

## What's deliberately out of scope

- **SAST**: Bandit / Semgrep / pyright security rules are not shipped. Add them as a `secure.*` task if needed.
- **Container scanning**: Trivy / Grype are not shipped. The deps image built by `container.publish` is a dev convenience, not a published artifact, so releases aren't gated on it.
- **License compliance**: SBOM includes license metadata, but the scaffold doesn't enforce license policies.
