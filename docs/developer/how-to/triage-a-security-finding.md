# Triage a security finding

`./workflow.cmd secure` runs [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit) against the lockfile. When it reports a vulnerability, you have three responses: upgrade, override with an expiry, or accept and document.

## Option 1. Upgrade if possible

The vast majority of findings have a fixed version available. Check the report:

```bash
./workflow.cmd secure.audit
```

If a fix exists upstream:

```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package <vulnerable-package>
./workflow.cmd secure.audit    # confirm clean
git commit -am "fix: bump <package> for <CVE-id>"
```

## Option 2. Override with an expiry (recommended for "can't upgrade yet")

The `.security-overrides` file at the project root lists allowed-for-now vulnerabilities with expiry dates. Each entry is a single token — the id and the optional expiry joined by `::`, with **no** justification field:

```text
<VULN_ID>[::YYYY-MM-DD]
```

The justification goes in a `#` comment, since anything after the id on the same line is not part of the entry:

```text
# upstream fix pending in v2.3 — see https://github.com/pkg/issue/42
PYSEC-2024-1234::2026-06-01
```

Malformed entries abort the task with a `file:line: <reason>` message rather than being silently ignored, so a typo fails loudly instead of quietly un-suppressing (or over-suppressing) a finding. Note the failure direction that matters: a mistyped expiry like `::2020-1-1` is rejected outright rather than being read as a *permanent* suppression.

After the expiry date, `secure.audit` fails again, forcing a re-triage. Don't extend overrides without revisiting the underlying issue. Omitting the expiry suppresses the finding permanently — prefer a date, because a permanent entry is never resurfaced.

## Option 3. Accept and document (rare)

For findings that don't apply to your usage — e.g. the vulnerable code path is gated on a feature you don't use — write an override with a thorough `#` justification and a far-future expiry. Keep this rare; the next maintainer needs to trust the override list.

## Where suppressions can come from

Three sources are merged, in this precedence order, and deduplicated by vulnerability id:

| Source | Permanent entries | Leaves a record in the repo |
|---|---|---|
| `--ignore` on the command line | **rejected** | no |
| `AFAS_MCP_SERVER_SECURITY_OVERRIDE` env var | **rejected** | no |
| `.security-overrides` | allowed | yes |

The first two must carry an `::YYYY-MM-DD` expiry. They are convenient for unblocking a single run, but nothing in the repository records that they were used — so an expiry-less entry there could mute a finding forever with no code change to review. A permanent suppression has to go in `.security-overrides`, where it shows up in a diff and gets read by whoever touches it next.

Whichever source they come from, the suppressions actually applied are printed with their origin before the audit runs:

```console
Applying 1 suppression(s):
  PYSEC-2024-1234 (expires 2026-06-01) from .security-overrides:12
```

Expired entries are reported too, naming the source, and then ignored — so the finding comes back rather than lingering behind a stale override.

## Where the audit runs

`secure.audit` is not only a local command — it gates automatically, which is what makes the expiry dates above meaningful:

- **Every CI run** — the `secure` job in `.github/workflows/continuous-integration.yaml` runs it alongside lint, test and build.
- **Daily on a schedule** — `.github/workflows/security-audit.yaml`. A dependency can turn out to be vulnerable, and an override can expire, with nobody pushing a commit; without the scheduled run a quiet repository would stop being checked and expiry dates would never come due. Trigger it by hand from the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`) to re-check on demand.
- **Pre-commit** — only `secure.validate-overrides`, and only when `.security-overrides` itself changes. That checks the file's syntax, not your dependencies.

## Re-running after a triage

```bash
./workflow.cmd secure
```

This runs the full security pass: audit, SBOM generation. Audit failures abort the run before SBOM upload.
