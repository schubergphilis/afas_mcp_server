    The pinned uv version reaches four places in `pyproject.toml` plus the base image's tag,

    to the *digest*, so a bumped tag beside a stale digest silently keeps building the old
    image. This updates all of them together or none at all, then re-locks so `uv.lock` agrees.

    The version was current when this project was generated; it does not advance on its own.
    Running this is how it moves.
